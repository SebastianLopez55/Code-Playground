# Code Playground

This repository serves as a code playground for testing various Python functionalities. It is intended as a space to experiment with different aspects of the Python language, including but not limited to data structures, algorithms, and standard library modules.

The purpose of this playground is to provide a set of examples and experiments that illustrate the use of Python for a range of tasks and challenges. There is no specific focus on any single aspect of Python; instead, the repository is open to all kinds of Python-related code experiments.
